## What is Windows Spotlight?
Windows Spotlight is a Windows feature that displays a rotating set of images on your lockscreen and desktop.

## How to Get These Images

### Method 1: Manually from Your PC
1. Go to:
   ```
   %LocalAppData%\Packages\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalCache\Microsoft\IrisService
   ```
2. Copy the files to another folder.
3. Open Command Prompt in that folder and run:
   ```cmd
   ren * *.jpg
   ```
   This will add the `.jpg` extension to all files so you can view them as images.

### Method 2: Download from This Repository
Browse the images in this repo and download your favorites directly.
